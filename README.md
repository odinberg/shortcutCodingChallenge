Coding challenge for shortcut - Odin Siljebøl

Done in SwiftUI

In my app the user can browse through comics by going to the next or previous comic, some buttons navigate +100/+10 or -100/-10. They can read the information about the comic and go to the explanation page if the user doesn´t understand it. Users can also favorite the comics. The image is an URL and I used AsyncImage so the user won't be able to look at the image offline.

The comic starts on a random number every time it runs so there should be a different comic every time the user opens the app. I didn't want my app to start on the first comic, the latest, or on a specific number. That's why I integrated the different buttons so there isn't just plus one or minus one comic every time. I wanted the app to be easy to understand and navigate through so there aren´t many views

I wanted the comic to be available offline too, I struggled with it for a few days and skipped it. All the other data from the comic is stored in core data. I didn't want to use any more time on this task since there were a few weeks since the interview and because of the bachelor thesis.
